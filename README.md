# ko.grid
Grid with support of paging and sorting, using knockout.js

The example is available on JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/iftifn/ug1v8x4h/

This library provides as simple as possible implementation of sortable grid with pager (using knockout.js). Library consists of single ko.grid.js script and ko.grid.css stylesheet. The stylesheet is provided to highlight all elements added dynamically by script, so end user may customize grid to his needs.

### Key features:
- Sorting
- Pager
- Sorting chain (you can 'sub-sort' by other columns after initial sort is done)

### Available sorting algorithms:
- alphabetic
- alphabeticCaseSensitive
- numeric

### Things to come:
- More sorting algorithms, like alphaNumeric
- Better example styling
